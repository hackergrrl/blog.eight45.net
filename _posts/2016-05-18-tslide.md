# tslide

[tslide][] is great. It's a minimal presentation program that adheres nicely to
the unix philosophy of doing one thing well.

It uses a single markdown file as its source. It uses `---` dividers to delimit
slides. Usage is as easy as

```
$ cat > talk.md

# hello world

let's talk about the question that's on everybody's mind

---

# yet another slide

what's the deal with marsupials
^D

$ tslide talk.md

(magic)

```

This'll show the same markdown as above, but per-slide, with the ability to use
the arrow keys or j/k to move through them.


## presenter notes

But what if you're like me and have notes? cues for yourself per-slide to help
jog your memory?

Ideally these notes you'll want to see on your laptop screen but not appear on
the big screen.


## do one thing well

I wrote [an elaborate PR](https://github.com/dominictarr/tslide/pull/9) to do
this. It was a bit complicated, and involved starting an HTTP server on one
tslide instance to help another instance connect, and only show speaker notes on
one.

But the best programs are the ones that do one thing well.

**ONE** thing.

How can we use !!**THE POWER OF UNIX**!! to avoid bloating an otherwise concise
program?


## pipes to the rescue

You'll want two terminals: one for the speaker, and one for the presenter.

In the speaker terminal, run

```
$ mkfifo present

$ tslide my_talk.md | tee present
```

And in the presentation terminal (the one on the big screen) run

```
$ cat present
```

poof

## but how?

Let's break this down step by step.

```
$ mkfifo present
```

The first command creates a [fifo pipe](), which one process can write to and it
will buffer until another process asks for the data.

```
$ tslide my_talk.md | tee present
```

The second tells `tslide` to start presenting to standard out, but also pipes
that output to `tee`, a program that lets its input flow through back to
standard out, but also writes a copy of it to a file of your choosing. Here I
choose the fifo from before, `present`.

You'll notice the command hangs here, waiting until I connect the other end to
`present` before running. this happens because fifos wait until a full pipeline
is present before letting the data flow.

Finally, in the second terminal I run

```
$ cat present
```

This tells the terminal to write the contents of `present` to standard out,
effectively mirroring everything the presenter sees, including the ansi codes
that deal with clearing the screen and applying colors and formatting effects
like bold.


## speaker notes

But wait, I thought I wanted speaker notes to not appear for the presentation
terminal?

One can do this with a slight modification to `cat present`:

```
$ cat present | grep -v "\s>"
```

This pipes each slide through the filtering program `grep`. If you aren't
already familiar with regular expressions, there's a few components to this:

1. `-v` tells grep to **omit** the lines it matches
2. `^` matches the beginning of a line
3. `\s` matches the whitespace group of characters
4. `\+` matches at least one of the preceding character (whitespace, in this
   case)
5. `>` is the markdown blockquote character

This will match all lines that have some whitespace leading up to a blockquote,
and omit those lines.

Tada!
