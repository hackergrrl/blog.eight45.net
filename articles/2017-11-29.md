### Excellent Command Line Tools

I spend most of my computer time on the command line. The command line is such a
powerful environment. Unlike graphical user interfaces, command line programs
are simple to create. That makes you can build your own more easily than
graphical programs, and it also makes it much easier to chain them together to
do tasks that dwarf the sum of their parts.

Excellent holistic tools are ones that are easy to learn and understand, but
empower and inspire. When used well, you barely even notice that they're there.

Here are some of my favourite tools, which empower and inspire me every day:
