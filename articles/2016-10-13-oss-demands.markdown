## My Conundrum

With the recent popularity of my article [Art of
README](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme) -- which has easily been my
most well-known work *ever*, I've experienced first hand what other more
prominent members of the OSS community know quite well: the deluge of pull
requests, issues, and outright demands of the community.

So I lamented this publicly on Twitter.

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting to feel a little overwhelmed by pull requests for the first time in my life. Gah! How do y&#39;all do it? :o</p>&mdash; Stephen Whitmore (@noffle) <a href="https://twitter.com/noffle/status/786315271682174976">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>

To my surprise, I very quickly received a small wealth of loving responses on
how to take care of both my users, but even moreso, *myself*.

Thanks everyone. I'll try and pace myself, and not let others' expectations
become internalized demands upon me. :)

It wasn't mentioned, but I think feeling this happening is also a *fantastic*
signal that it may be time to add more collaborators with commit rights to your
projects. Look for folks who have been dedicating time, effort, and love to your
projects and show them you appreciate them by giving them the trust and power to
contribute more freely!
