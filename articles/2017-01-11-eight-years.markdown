# Eight Years

Spurred by [ev's blog post](http://evbogue.com/eightyears/), I felt compelled to
share a bit about where I was eight years ago, where I am today, and where I see
myself in another eight years.

This was a fun exercise to help me see both a) how far I've come!, and b) focus
on my present-day trajectory toward the future.

## Me: Eight years ago

- 2009
- still a university student
- living in waterloo, on
- doing an internship at sony writing dvd authoring software
- had just discovered linux the year prior and was digging in DEEP
- running ubuntu on my laptop experimentally (windows dualboot)
- had JUST started dating my first girlfriend
- had no idea who I was
- had no idea I had no idea who I was
- did lots of game development
- no open source, but I thought it looked cool
- lurked on various open source mailing lists in awe
- node wasn't invented yet
- knew virtually zero javascript
- I had never left the continent
- had only left the country once (Florida)
- thought I was straight
- never meditated before
- terrified of cities

## Me: Today

- 2017
- I write open source software for a living
- I don't write any proprietary / closed source code any more, ever
- I live in california with my partner
- moving to oakland this year!
- I don't really write video games any more
- I'm studying buddhism & zen
- I meditate nearly every day
- I understand my own mental health more deeply than ever before
- I have more ability to trust others than ever before


## Me: Eight years in the future

- live off the grid (solar, wind, river powered hacks)
- live somewhere that I don't need a work visa to not be deported
- continue to write open source software full-time
- be funded by donations to my work, so I can focus on what matters to me
- have very little need or use for money
- be and feel fully content with what I have & escape the bottomless hole of consumerism
- feel healthy, stable, and at peace with myself and the world
- eat a healthy diet, devoid of processed foods
- have a garden where I grow a bunch of my own food
- run a regular blog (like this one!) that helps and inspires people
- deep connections to communities that matter to me and make the world a better
  place


## My goals for society in eight years

- a rich ecosystem of quality, secure, user empowering peer-to-peer software
- open source is the new software default
- cooperatives are the new business default
- more communal property ownership; less exploitative ownership
