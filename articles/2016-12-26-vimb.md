To understand vimb, you will first benefit from knowing of
[vim](http://www.vim.org/): a highly configurable text editor. It's unique in
that it is one of the oldest text editors still in active use today: in fact,
vim just turned 25 years old this year!

vim makes for efficient text editing due to its focus on most operations being
accessible from the home row of your keyboard. You can operate vim entirely
without a mouse.

vimb takes these attractive properties and extends them to the web: a
lightweight browser that can be operated using the keyboard alone, that is
highly configurable. A lofty goal!

## Getting started

### Installation

vimb plays best with Linux. Odds are, vimb can be found via your package
manager.

If you are running Windows or macOS, then you'll have to go down the less
traveled road of building [vimb from its source
code](https://github.com/fanglingsu/vimb#install).

### Orientation

When you run vimb for the first time, you'll find yourself on the vimb website.
Hit 'f' to bring up link hints, and type the letter beside the 'man' heading
along the top. This will bring up the program manual. It's a bit dense, but
worth skimming to get an idea of what key bindings are available out of the box.

vimb lets you follow links by showing *link hints* when you press certain keys.
The default is 'f' (for "follow"). It makes the screen look like this:

![vimb follow mode](https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/media/vimb-hints.png)

Here are some of the keys you'll find yourself using the most:

- `j` and `k` scroll your viewport up and down. `h` and `l` for horizontal
  motion. These will feel familiar if you've used vim. Try some other vim keys:
  you may find them to be identical here in vimb.
- Spacebar jumps down a half-page. `Shift+Spacebar` jumps back up. Use `CTRL+f`
  and `CTRL-b` to do full-page jumps.
- `gg` jumps to the top of the page; `G` jumps to the bottom.
- `f` follows a link in the current window. Use `F` to follow a link into a
  brand new window.
- `o` lets you type in a url to open in the current window. `O` does the same,
  put pre-loads the current url into the text field. Use `t` and `T` to do the
  same for opening a new window.
- `CTRL+O` and `CTRL+I` navigate Back and Forward, respectively. I found this
  awkward; see below in CONFIGURATION for tips on changing this to be more
  intuitive.
- `Esc` closes most prompts and menus.
- Finally, `:q` will quit vimb.

vimb has great tab completion. Hit `o` and type in a substring of the url of any
website you've visited, hit `TAB`, and you'll get a list to choose from. It even
matches website titles!

These should be enough pieces for everyday navigation, but do peruse [the
manual](https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/man.html) for even more.

### Configuration

On Linux, vimb looks in `~/.config/vimb/config` for configuration information.
Here are some tidbits from my setup that you might find helpful for tailoring
vimb to your needs:

```
# Makes the last 30k websites you visited searchable.
set history-max-items=30000

# Choose your own keys for hint titles. I try to stick to the home row.
set hintkeys=jklfds;a123467890

# Rebind Back and Forward to something more convenient.
nnoremap H <C-O>
nnoremap L <C-I>

# I find just tapping 'qq' easier than :q<ENTER>.
nnoremap qq :q<CR>

# Tweak font sizes as per your preferences.
set fontsize=10
set monofontsize=9
set minimumfontsize=7

# I like browsing with Javascript turned off by default. However, if a website
# needs it, can I just hit ! and have the page reload with JS activated.
set scripts=off
nnoremap ! :set scripts!<CR>r
```

### Search engines

vimb lets you configure various search engines, which is more generally a
facility for what it calls "shortcuts".

For example, if I had a line like the following in my `~/.config/vimb/config`:

```
shortcut-add d=https://duckduckgo.com/?q=$0
```

I could then type `o d nodejs<ENTER>` in vimb to perform a
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) search for "nodejs". It's easy to add
others!

```
" Google
shortcut-add g=https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=$0

" NodeJS modules
shortcut-add n=http://node-modules.com/search?q=$0

" Arch Linux wiki
shortcut-add a=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Special%%3ASearch&search=$0&go=Go
```

If you end up using vimb with Javascript turned off by default as well,
DuckDuckGo has a super fast [HTML-only version of their
site](https://duckduckgo.com/html). Add it to your configuration:

```
shortcut-add d=https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=$0
```


### Where are the tabs!?

vimb tries to embrace the [UNIX
Philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html) of single
programs that do one thing well.

The developers decided that this means not including any tab management by
default. Each "tab" command, like `t http://blog.eight45.net` will, you may have
noticed, open a brand new vimb window.

This takes some getting used to. The behaviour isn't "bad" perse, just different
than a pattern that the majority of web browsers employ. I've noticed that this
frustrates some people.

You have a couple of options. The official approach is to use a separate program
to manage tabs. vimb supports the [XEmbed
protocol](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/xembed-spec/xembed-spec-latest.html#overview),
meaning you can use a separate program like
[tabbed](http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/) to manage tabs within a wrapping
parent window. Once `tabbed` is installed, run vimb as `tabbed -c vimb -e`. You
can find more information in the [vimb
FAQ](https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/faq.html#tabbed)

Another approach, which is the one I use, is to embrace the one-window-per-tab
philosophy and make use of a [tiling window
manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) to keep track of
your windows. I often use [i3](http://i3wm.org/)'s "tabbed layout", which lays
out my vimb windows in in tabs not unlike traditional browsers, except with the
added benefit that each tab is its own separate process that can be managed,
killed, or suspended.

### Passthrough mode

Web apps that require a high amounts of mouse interactions, such as [map viewer
websites](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), will not work quite right out of the
box. Fortunately, pressing `CTRL+Z` puts vimb into PASSTHROUGH mode, which
deactivates all of vimb's vim key bindings and makes it operate much like a
traditional web browser.

You can hit Escape at any time to return to Normal mode.

## Who is vimb for?

I've been using vimb as my default web browser for the last four months, with no
intention of turning back. I've gotten by swimmingly: it's a joy to use, and
is configured in a way that would be difficult using a traditional browser like
Chrome or Firefox.

vimb is for you if you like..

1. ..a more lightweight web browser, that eats up less memory and cpu
   cycles and loads pages faster.
2. ..idea of foregoing the mouse when browsing the web.
3. ..being able to configure just about any aspect of how your web browser
   works.

## Who is vimb not for?

vimb might not be for you if you rely on..

1. ..cutting edge web features, like WebGL or WebRTC. Common for most
   web games, or video/voice calling apps.
2. ..the Flash or Silverlight plugins. Common for watching videos on
   Amazon or Netflix.

Since I do occassionally require some of the above from time to time, I've found
it useful to keep Chrome or Firefox around for certain websites.

For YouTube and other video sites, I use
[youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) to download videos locally and
watch them with [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html). (Though I
hear [you-get](https://github.com/soimort/you-get) is an exciting up-and-coming
youtube-dl contender!)

## Try it out!

Give vimb a try! Even if vim isn't your editor of choice, using a
keyboard-driven web browser is a unique and interesting experience that ought to
broaden your horizons about what exactly a web browser is.
