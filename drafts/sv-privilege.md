- silicon valley privilege
  - pc speed and internet latency/bandwidth
    - ecuador: low throughput and 12 *second* latency
  - most people aren't as rich as software engineers (sorry)
  - we are complicit (/w our fast pcs and internet)
  - "the cloud" is inherently privileged
    - local storage is NOT
    - question the assumption that everything must be stored in a data centre
- mapping offline in the amazon
- where you can help
  - use a slow computer
    - don't fret about losing it!
    - nobody will want to steal it
    - inexpensive
  - write code and test your app offline
    - offline coding workflow (git, hyper*, ipfs, ssb, git-ssb[-web], cyberhobo)
    - write code in non-brandname coffee shops (to experience a broad range of coffee *and* wifi quality)
      - no internet usually > poor internet
    - cloud apps are an inherent part of the problem
      - cloud as an _optional_ backend
      - *local storage is the default!*
    - node specific tips (npm --cache-min, `readme, readme -c`)
- further reading
  - telekommunisten manifesto
  - elimination of television / absence of the sacred
