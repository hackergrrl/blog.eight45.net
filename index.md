## Me in a nutshell

Hello traveler! My name is noffle, or sometimes Stephen.

Iâ€™m slowly exploring the world while writing open source software, studying my

up between me and life as I can manage. *[Read more about me](about.html)*.

This website is my attempt to document my life in a way that inspires, educates,
and illuminates.
