Hi, I'm Stephen. I'm sometimes known as *noffle* on the internet.

In mid-2016, I decided that I had had enough of living my life suffering and
asleep. Since then I've been on an inner journey, studying topics like buddhism,
stoicism, taoism, modern psychology, and other sources. I seek fearlessness; to
be in tune with my body and the earth, to share what I know, and to open myself
to others and experiences enough for deep, meaningful connections.

I am presently aspiring toward..
- writing [open source programs](https://github.com/noffle) that empower others
- becoming aware of my consumption and waste
- growing more in tune with nature
- traveling the world
- owning only what I need
- relying less and less on money
- a mindset of abundance instead of scarcity
- learning to love myself and others
- inspiring others to live freely & joyfully

I'm currently doing working with [Digital
Democracy](http://www.digital-democracy.org/) to build a modular [peer-to-peer
mapping architecture](https://github.com/digidem/osm-p2p-db) that lets anybody
create digital maps, even without the internet!

You can reach me best by [email](mailto:sww@eight45.net) or
[Twitter](https:/twitter.com/noffle). I'm also on [distributed social
media](https://scuttlebutt.nz).

I'm experimenting with accepting donations for my open source programs and
writing. Send me [an email](mailto:sww@eight45.net) if you'd like to send me
money. If you know what PGP is, here is my [public
key](http://eight45.net/pgp.asc).
