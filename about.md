Hi, I'm Stephen. I'm known as *noffle* on the internet.

I am a..
- aspiring explorer
- aspiring minimalist
- aspiring do'er
- student of stoicism & buddhism
- scrappy hacker

I used to be many other things, but [titles not exercised are titles
expired](https://sivers.org/expire).

Right now, I make [free open source tools](https://github.com/noffle) to empower
myself and others to live more freely.

Since mid-2016, when I decided that I had had enough of living my life asleep,
I've been studying buddhism, stoicism, and my own ad-hoc method of exploring my
mind, body, and life. I seek to be fearless, in tune with my body, and to open
myself to others and experiences enough for deep, meaningful connections.

I'm currently doing independent work with [Digital
Democracy](http://www.digital-democracy.org/), building a modular [peer-to-peer
mapping architecture](https://github.com/digidem/osm-p2p-db) that lets anybody
create digital maps, even without the internet.

You can reach me best by [email](mailto:sww@eight45.net) or
[Twitter](https:/twitter.com/noffle). I'm also on [distributed social
media](http://ssbc.github.io/patchwork/).

If you like the work I do, don't send me money. Send me [a thank you](mailto:sww@eight45.net).

If you know what PGP is, [here is my public key](http://eight45.net/pgp.asc).
