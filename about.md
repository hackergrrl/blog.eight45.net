Hi, I'm *noffle*.

In mid-2016, I decided that I had had enough of living my life suffering and
asleep. Since then I've been on an inner journey, studying topics like buddhism,
stoicism, taoism, modern psychology, and other sources. I seek fearlessness; to
be in tune with my body and the earth, to share what I know, and to open myself
to others and experiences enough for deep, meaningful connections.

I am presently aspiring toward..
- writing [open source programs](https://github.com/noffle) for people, not profit
- becoming aware of my consumption and waste
- growing more in tune with nature
- traveling the world respectfully & responsibly
- owning only what I need
- relying less and less on money
- a mindset of abundance instead of scarcity
- learning to love myself and others
- inspiring others to live freely & joyfully

I'm currently doing work with [Digital
Democracy](http://www.digital-democracy.org/) to build a modular [peer-to-peer
mapping architecture](https://github.com/digidem/osm-p2p-db) that lets anybody
create digital maps, even without the internet! It's being used to empower
indigenous peoples in South America to fight back against ecological abuse and
seek their land rights.

You can reach me best by [email](mailto:sww@eight45.net) or
[Twitter](https:/twitter.com/noffle). I'm also on [distributed social
media, called *SSB*](https://scuttlebutt.nz).

I tried running an experiment where I accepted donations for my work, but
something about it didn't feel right.

I'm experimenting with accepting donations for my open source programs and
writing. Send me [an email](mailto:sww@eight45.net) if you'd like to send me
money. If you know what PGP is, here is my [public
key](http://eight45.net/pgp.asc).
