# CHAIN SWORD

CHAIN SWORD is a small single-screen multiplayer game, where you try to defeat the other players using a sword that is also a grappling hook.

Two players can play with one keyboard: `WASD + O, P` and `ARROWS + Z, X`.

Or you can play with gamepads, which supports up to four players at once. This is by far the most enjoyable way to play.
